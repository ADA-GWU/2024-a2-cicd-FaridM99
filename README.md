Web application using Spring Boot for Automated Testing

Description 

Project is a web application developed using my own application that I was created on Web and Mobile 2 class – which is Assignment 1 called as a CRUD operations with Spring Boot. It includes automated testing implemented with Selenium WebDriver to ensure the reliability and functionality of the web application's user interface. Before the starting, I would like to talk about Why We Need SeleniumTest, because of the efficiency, accuracy, scalability, continuous integration (CI) that is integrates easily with CI/CD pipelines. I have used three test cases for my own application:
